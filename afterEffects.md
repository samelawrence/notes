## How to make an animated visualizer

- Gather all your assets
- Clip your audio down to the 30/60/90 seconds you want to highlight (or do
  this in advance)
- Render the audio clip as frame (I think?)
- Create the new audio-reactive line and link it to the audio
- Set sample rate and style
- Map image zoom to the audio as well
